## The Samurai Warrior Code

The samurai of ancient Japan followed a sequence of rules called the Bushido or “The Way of the Warrior”. These philosophical codes and guiding principles were specifically for the samurai warriors.

During the medieval period in Japan, the samurai were present to serve their lord and protect the land. Though the warriors are no longer in service, their influence is still evident since some Japanese still refer to the Bushido in this day and age.

## The Seven Virtues

The Seven Virtues of Bushido are:

- Gi – (Justice or Integrity)
- Yu (Courage)
- Jin – (Mercy or Benevolence)
- Rei – (Respect)
- Makoto – (Honesty)
- Meiyo – (Honor)
- Chugi – (Loyalty)

Gi – Justice or Integrity
This is ensuring that the individual has the right way and mindset when making decisions – that they have the power to decide swiftly. It is to guarantee that the person avoids indecisiveness and that decisions are based on the proper reasons.

Yu – Courage
Yu is focused on ensuring that an individual does and has the courage to do the right thing, not what others expect them to do. If a person is raised particularly, they have their own beliefs that they follow and have the courage to do.

Jin – Mercy or Benevolence
As great warriors, samurai have the right power to kill; yet due to the Bushido, Jin is to ensure that their mind and thinking is balanced – having mercy and sympathy at the proper situation.

Rei – Respect
Based on the belief of a samurai, it is important that they respect and be polite towards everything. Their way of life meant they should be respectful of elders, respect life, and respect the belief of others.

Makoto – Honesty
Honesty was always vital since the warriors believe that honesty in everything they do will acquire respect. It would also mean that they are trustworthy.

Meiyo – Honor
Living and dying with great honor was vital to every samurai warrior. Everything they did was with great honor; meaning, everything that they did based on their belief was with honor.

Another vital aspect of the Bushido was loyalty. The samurai treated each other just like family and would safeguard and help their fellow warriors.
